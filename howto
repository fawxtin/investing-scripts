Hello, you can properly make use of investing.com tools in your command line shell!


### Install and simple usage

1) To install these scripts, you simply type:

$ make install

It will copy the files into your $HOME/bin directory. 

2) Then, type:

$ investing

it will show the usage of it. 

But, to proper make use of it, you will need to get your investing.com 
token (logged in at the site), its the "ses_id" Cookie.

3) Copy and paste this Cookie to the envvar $INVESTING_COM_TOKEN

$ export INVESTING_COM_TOKEN="copy-pasta"

Do it on your ~/.profile so you wont need to redo this everytime you open 
your console.

### Portfolios

Usually the investing.com PortfolioID is urlencoded, so you must pick this ID
and urldecode it. Usually I manually go to https://www.urldecoder.org/ and paste it.

Aftwards, simply export it as an envvar:

$ export INVESTING_COM_PORTFOLIO="url-decoded portfolioID"

and now you can view your portfolio as:

$ investing portfolio view

There is a panel command that is in progress, that shows price in action into a 
curses window.

$ investing portfolio panel
